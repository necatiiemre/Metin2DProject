> We have done this project thanks to a playlist named 'Java 2D Game Tutorial' <br> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI&list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq&index=1 <br><br>
We've used these topics in our project from this tutorial:
> - Usig Keyboard for controls. <br>
> - Making map and manage it. <br>
> - How to interact with objects. <br>
